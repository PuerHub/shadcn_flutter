description: "A button styled as a card with elevated appearance and extensive gesture support."

```dart
/// A button styled as a card with elevated appearance and extensive gesture support.
///
/// Provides an alternative button presentation that resembles a card with
/// elevated styling, typically used for prominent actions or content sections
/// that need to stand out from the background. The card styling provides
/// visual depth and emphasis compared to standard button variants.
///
/// Supports the full range of button features including leading/trailing widgets,
/// focus management, gesture handling, and accessibility features. The card
/// appearance is defined by [ButtonStyle.card] with customizable size,
/// density, and shape properties.
///
/// The component handles complex gesture interactions including primary,
/// secondary, and tertiary taps, long presses, hover states, and focus
/// management, making it suitable for rich interactive experiences.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// CardButton(
///   leading: Icon(Icons.dashboard),
///   trailing: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
///   size: ButtonSize.large,
///   onPressed: () => Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/dashboard'),
///   child: Column(
///     children: [
///       Text('Dashboard', style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
///       Text('View analytics and reports'),
///     ],
///   ),
/// )
/// ```

  /// and elevated visual treatment.

  ///
  /// Called when the user taps or clicks the button. If null,
  /// the button is disabled and does not respond to interactions.
  final VoidCallback? onPressed;
  /// Whether this button is enabled and accepts user input.
  ///
  /// When false, the button is displayed in a disabled state and
  /// ignores user interactions. When null, enabled state is determined
  /// by whether [onPressed] is provided.

  /// Optional widget displayed before the main content.
  ///
  /// Commonly used for icons that visually represent the button's action.
  /// Positioned to the left of the content in LTR layouts.

  ///
  /// Often used for indicators, chevrons, or secondary actions.
  /// Positioned to the right of the content in LTR layouts.
  final Widget? trailing;
  /// Alignment of content within the button.
  ///
  /// Controls how the button's content is positioned within its bounds.
  /// Defaults to center alignment if not specified.
  final AlignmentGeometry? alignment;
  /// Size variant for the button appearance.
  ///
  /// Controls padding, font size, and overall dimensions. Available
  /// sizes include small, normal, large, and extra large variants.
  final ButtonSize size;
  /// Density setting affecting button compactness.
  ///
  /// Controls spacing and padding to create more or less compact
  /// appearance. Useful for dense interfaces or accessibility needs.
  final ButtonDensity density;
  /// Shape configuration for the button's appearance.
  ///
  /// Defines border radius and corner styling. Options include
  /// rectangle, rounded corners, and circular shapes.
  final ButtonShape shape;
  /// Focus node for keyboard navigation and accessibility.
  ///
  /// Manages focus state for the button. If not provided, a focus
  /// node is created automatically by the underlying button system.
  final FocusNode? focusNode;
  /// Whether to disable visual transition animations.
  ///
  /// When true, the button skips animation effects for state changes.
  /// Useful for performance optimization or accessibility preferences.
  final bool disableTransition;
  /// Callback invoked when hover state changes.
  ///
  /// Called with true when the mouse enters the button area,
  /// and false when it exits. Useful for custom hover effects.
  final ValueChanged<bool>? onHover;
  /// Callback invoked when focus state changes.
  ///
  /// Called with true when the button gains focus, and false
  /// when it loses focus. Supports keyboard navigation patterns.
  final ValueChanged<bool>? onFocus;
  /// Whether to enable haptic/audio feedback.
  final bool? enableFeedback;
  /// Called when primary tap down occurs.
  final GestureTapDownCallback? onTapDown;
  /// Called when primary tap up occurs.
  final GestureTapUpCallback? onTapUp;
  /// Called when primary tap is cancelled.
  final GestureTapCancelCallback? onTapCancel;
  /// Called when secondary tap down occurs.

  /// Called when long press moves.
  final GestureLongPressMoveUpdateCallback? onLongPressMoveUpdate;
  /// Called when long press ends.
  final GestureLongPressEndCallback? onLongPressEnd;

  /// The [child] parameter is required and provides the button's main content.
  /// The button uses card styling with elevated appearance for visual prominence.
  /// Extensive gesture support enables complex interactions beyond simple taps.
  ///
  /// Parameters include standard button properties (onPressed, enabled, leading,
  /// trailing) along with size, density, and shape customization options.
  /// Gesture callbacks support primary, secondary, tertiary taps and long presses.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [child] (Widget, required): The main content displayed in the button
  /// - [onPressed] (VoidCallback?, optional): Primary action when button is pressed
  /// - [enabled] (bool?, optional): Whether button accepts input (null uses onPressed)
  /// - [size] (ButtonSize, default: normal): Size variant for button dimensions
  /// - [density] (ButtonDensity, default: normal): Spacing density setting
  /// - [shape] (ButtonShape, default: rectangle): Border radius and corner styling
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// CardButton(
  ///   size: ButtonSize.large,
  ///   leading: Icon(Icons.star),
  ///   onPressed: () => _handleFavorite(),
  ///   child: Text('Add to Favorites'),
  /// )
