```dart
/// A container widget that creates resizable panels separated by interactive dividers.
///
/// This widget provides a flexible layout system where multiple child panes
/// can be resized by the user through draggable dividers. It supports both
/// horizontal and vertical orientations, allowing users to adjust the relative
/// sizes of the contained panels by dragging the separators between them.
///
/// Each [ResizablePane] child can have its own sizing constraints, minimum and
/// maximum sizes, and collapse behavior. The panel automatically manages the
/// distribution of available space and handles user interactions for resizing.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// ResizablePanel.horizontal(
///   children: [
///     ResizablePane(
///       child: Container(color: Colors.red),
///       minSize: 100,
///       defaultSize: 200,
///     ),
///     ResizablePane(
///       child: Container(color: Colors.blue),
///       flex: 1,
///     ),
///     ResizablePane(
///       child: Container(color: Colors.green),
///       defaultSize: 150,
///       maxSize: 300,
///     ),
///   ],
/// );
/// ```

  /// horizontal layouts.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [children] (List<ResizablePane>, required): The panes to arrange horizontally
  /// - [dividerBuilder] (OptionalWidgetBuilder?, optional): Custom divider builder
  /// - [draggerBuilder] (OptionalWidgetBuilder?, optional): Custom dragger builder
  /// - [draggerThickness] (double?, optional): Size of the draggable resize area

  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// ResizablePanel.horizontal(

  ///     ResizablePane(child: LeftSidebar(), defaultSize: 200),
  ///     ResizablePane(child: MainContent(), flex: 1),

  ///
  /// This is a convenience constructor that sets [direction] to [Axis.vertical]

  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [children] (List<ResizablePane>, required): The panes to arrange vertically
  /// - [dividerBuilder] (OptionalWidgetBuilder?, optional): Custom divider builder
  /// - [draggerBuilder] (OptionalWidgetBuilder?, optional): Custom dragger builder
  /// - [draggerThickness] (double?, optional): Size of the draggable resize area
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// ResizablePanel.vertical(
  ///   children: [
  ///     ResizablePane(child: Header(), defaultSize: 60),
  ///     ResizablePane(child: Content(), flex: 1),

  ///
  /// This is the general constructor that allows full customization of the
  /// panel orientation and behavior. Use the convenience constructors
  /// [ResizablePanel.horizontal] and [ResizablePanel.vertical] for typical use cases.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [direction] (Axis, required): The axis along which panes are arranged

  /// - [draggerThickness] (double?, optional): Size of the draggable resize area
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// ResizablePanel(
