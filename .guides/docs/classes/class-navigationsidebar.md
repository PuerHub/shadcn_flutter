```dart
/// A full-width navigation sidebar component for comprehensive navigation.
///
/// Provides an expanded navigation interface designed for sidebar layouts
/// with full-width items and extensive labeling support. Unlike [NavigationRail],
/// the sidebar is optimized for detailed navigation with prominent labels,
/// descriptions, and expanded interactive areas.
///
/// The sidebar always displays labels and typically occupies a dedicated
/// sidebar area in layouts. Items are arranged vertically with generous
/// spacing and padding to create a comfortable navigation experience.
/// Supports badges, icons, and detailed labeling for complex navigation hierarchies.
///
/// Integrates with responsive layout systems and can be combined with
/// collapsible containers or drawer systems for adaptive navigation
/// experiences across different screen sizes and device types.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// NavigationSidebar(
///   backgroundColor: Colors.grey.shade50,
///   labelType: NavigationLabelType.all,
///   index: currentPageIndex,
///   onSelected: (index) => _navigateToPage(index),
///   children: [
///     NavigationBarItem(
///       icon: Icon(Icons.dashboard),
///       label: 'Dashboard',
///       badge: Badge(child: Text('New')),
///     ),
///     NavigationBarItem(
///       icon: Icon(Icons.analytics),
///       label: 'Analytics',
///     ),
///     NavigationBarItem(
///       icon: Icon(Icons.settings),
///       label: 'Settings',
///     ),
///   ],
/// )
/// ```

  ///
  /// Controls label placement within each navigation item. Sidebars
  /// commonly position labels to the end (right in LTR layouts) of icons.

  /// Size variant for label text and item dimensions.
  ///
  /// Affects text size and overall item scale. Larger sizes improve
  /// accessibility and visual prominence in sidebar contexts.
  final NavigationLabelSize labelSize;
  /// Internal padding applied within the navigation sidebar.
  ///
  /// Provides space around navigation items, preventing them from
  /// touching the sidebar's edges and creating visual comfort.

  ///
  /// Defines width and height bounds for the sidebar. Useful for
  /// responsive layouts and consistent sidebar sizing.

  ///
  /// Highlights the corresponding item with selected styling.
  /// When null, no item appears selected.
  final int? index;
  /// Callback invoked when a navigation item is selected.
  ///
  /// Called with the index of the selected item. Use this to update
  /// the selection state and handle navigation actions.
  final ValueChanged<int>? onSelected;
  /// Opacity level for surface background effects.
  ///
  /// Controls transparency of background overlays and blur effects.
  /// Values range from 0.0 (transparent) to 1.0 (opaque).
  final double? surfaceOpacity;
  /// Blur intensity for surface background effects.
  ///
  /// Controls backdrop blur effects behind the sidebar surface.
  /// Higher values create more pronounced blur effects.
  final double? surfaceBlur;
  /// Whether the sidebar should expand to fill available width.
  ///
  /// When true, the sidebar uses all available horizontal space.
  /// When false, the sidebar sizes itself to its content width.
  final bool expanded;
  /// Whether to maintain intrinsic size along the cross axis.
  ///
  /// Controls width sizing behavior when the sidebar's width
  /// constraints are unconstrained.
  final bool keepCrossAxisSize;
  /// Whether to maintain intrinsic size along the main axis.
  ///
  /// Controls height sizing behavior when the sidebar's height
  /// constraints are unconstrained.
  final bool keepMainAxisSize;
  /// Creates a [NavigationSidebar] with the specified configuration and items.
  ///
  /// The [children] parameter is required and should contain [NavigationBarItem]
  /// widgets that define the navigation destinations. Default values are
  /// optimized for sidebar presentation with expanded labels and large sizing.
  ///
  /// The sidebar defaults to expanded label presentation with large sizing
  /// and end-positioned labels, creating a comprehensive navigation experience
  /// suitable for desktop and tablet interfaces.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [children] (List<NavigationBarItem>, required): Navigation destinations
  /// - [labelType] (NavigationLabelType, default: expanded): Label display behavior
  /// - [labelPosition] (NavigationLabelPosition, default: end): Label positioning
  /// - [labelSize] (NavigationLabelSize, default: large): Size variant for items
  /// - [index] (int?, optional): Currently selected item index
  /// - [onSelected] (ValueChanged<int>?, optional): Selection change callback
  /// - [expanded] (bool, default: true): Whether to fill available width

  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// NavigationSidebar(
  ///   backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.surface,
  ///   index: selectedIndex,
  ///   onSelected: (index) => _handleNavigation(index),
