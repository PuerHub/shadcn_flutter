```dart
/// A versatile, customizable button widget with comprehensive styling and interaction support.
///
/// [Button] is the foundational interactive widget in the shadcn_flutter design system,
/// providing a consistent and accessible button implementation with extensive customization
/// options. It supports multiple visual variants, sizes, shapes, and interaction patterns
/// while maintaining design system consistency.
///
/// ## Key Features
/// - **Multiple Variants**: Primary, secondary, outline, ghost, link, text, destructive, and more
/// - **Flexible Sizing**: From extra small to extra large with custom scaling
/// - **Shape Options**: Rectangle and circle shapes with customizable borders
/// - **Rich Interactions**: Hover, focus, press, and long press support
/// - **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
/// - **Theming**: Deep integration with the design system theme
/// - **Form Integration**: Works seamlessly with form validation and state management
///
/// ## Visual Variants
/// The button supports various visual styles through named constructors:
/// - [Button.primary]: Prominent primary actions with filled background
/// - [Button.secondary]: Secondary actions with muted background
/// - [Button.outline]: Actions with outline border and transparent background
/// - [Button.ghost]: Subtle actions with minimal visual weight
/// - [Button.link]: Text-only actions that appear as links
/// - [Button.text]: Plain text actions with hover effects
/// - [Button.destructive]: Dangerous actions with destructive styling
/// - [Button.card]: Card-like appearance for container buttons
///
/// ## Layout and Content
/// Buttons can contain text, icons, or a combination of both using [leading] and [trailing]
/// widgets. The [child] widget is automatically aligned and sized according to the button's
/// style and density settings.
///
/// ## Interaction Handling
/// The button provides comprehensive gesture support including tap, long press, secondary
/// clicks, and tertiary clicks. All interactions respect the [enabled] state and provide
/// appropriate visual and haptic feedback.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// Button.primary(
///   onPressed: () => print('Primary action'),
///   leading: Icon(Icons.add),
///   trailing: Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
///   child: Text('Create New'),
/// );
/// ```
class Button extends StatefulWidget {
  /// Whether the button is interactive.
  ///
  /// If null, the button is enabled when [onPressed] is not null. When false,
  /// the button appears disabled and doesn't respond to user input or fire callbacks.
  final bool? enabled;
  /// Whether to disable visual state transition animations.
  ///
  /// When true, the button immediately snaps between visual states instead of
  /// smoothly animating. Useful for performance optimization in lists or when
  /// animations would be distracting.
  final bool disableTransition;
  /// Widget displayed to the left of the main child content.
  ///
  /// Commonly used for icons that provide additional context about the button's
  /// action. Automatically spaced from the [child] with appropriate gaps.
  final Widget? leading;
  /// Widget displayed to the right of the main child content.
  ///
  /// Often used for icons indicating direction (arrows) or additional actions.
  /// Automatically spaced from the [child] with appropriate gaps.
  final Widget? trailing;
  /// The primary content displayed in the button.
  ///
  /// Typically contains text, icons, or other widgets that describe the button's
  /// action. Automatically aligned according to [alignment] and styled according
  /// to the button's [style].
  final Widget child;
  /// Callback invoked when the button is pressed.
  ///
  /// The primary interaction callback for the button. When null, the button becomes
  /// disabled unless [enabled] is explicitly set to true. The button automatically
  /// handles loading states, disabled states, and provides haptic feedback.
  final VoidCallback? onPressed;
  /// Focus node for keyboard navigation and focus management.
  ///
  /// If null, a focus node is automatically created. Useful for controlling focus
  /// programmatically or integrating with form focus traversal.
  final FocusNode? focusNode;
  /// Alignment of the child content within the button.
  ///
  /// Controls how the [child] is positioned within the button's bounds. Defaults
  /// to center alignment for most button types. When [leading] or [trailing] are
  /// provided, defaults to start alignment.
  final AlignmentGeometry? alignment;
  /// Visual styling configuration for the button.
  ///
  /// Defines the button's appearance including colors, padding, borders, and text
  /// styles. The [AbstractButtonStyle] provides state-aware styling that responds
  /// to hover, press, focus, and disabled states.
  final AbstractButtonStyle style;
  /// Callback invoked when the button's hover state changes.
  ///
  /// Called with true when the pointer enters the button area and false when it
  /// leaves. Useful for implementing custom hover effects or updating external state.
  final ValueChanged<bool>? onHover;
  /// Callback invoked when the button's focus state changes.
  ///
  /// Called with true when the button gains focus and false when it loses focus.
  /// Useful for accessibility features or coordinating focus with other widgets.
  final ValueChanged<bool>? onFocus;
  /// Whether to enable haptic feedback on press.
  ///
  /// If null, haptic feedback is automatically enabled on mobile platforms.
  /// When true, provides tactile feedback when the button is pressed. When false,
  /// no haptic feedback is provided regardless of platform.
  final bool? enableFeedback;
  /// Callback invoked when a tap down gesture begins.
  ///
  /// Provides the position and details of the initial touch/click. Useful for
  /// implementing custom press animations or tracking interaction start points.
  final GestureTapDownCallback? onTapDown;
  /// Callback invoked when a tap up gesture completes.
  ///
  /// Called after a successful tap gesture, providing the position details.
  /// Note that [onPressed] is typically preferred for button actions.
  final GestureTapUpCallback? onTapUp;
  /// Callback invoked when a tap gesture is canceled.
  ///
  /// Called when a tap gesture starts but is interrupted before completion,
  /// such as when the pointer moves outside the button area.
  final GestureTapCancelCallback? onTapCancel;
  /// Callback invoked when a secondary button (right-click) tap down begins.
  ///
  /// Useful for implementing context menus or alternative actions.
  final GestureTapDownCallback? onSecondaryTapDown;
  /// Callback invoked when a secondary button tap up completes.
  final GestureTapUpCallback? onSecondaryTapUp;
  /// Callback invoked when a secondary button tap is canceled.
  final GestureTapCancelCallback? onSecondaryTapCancel;
  /// Callback invoked when a tertiary button (middle-click) tap down begins.
  final GestureTapDownCallback? onTertiaryTapDown;
  /// Callback invoked when a tertiary button tap up completes.
  final GestureTapUpCallback? onTertiaryTapUp;
  /// Callback invoked when a tertiary button tap is canceled.
  final GestureTapCancelCallback? onTertiaryTapCancel;
  /// Callback invoked when a long press gesture begins.
  ///
  /// Provides the position where the long press started. Useful for implementing
  /// press-and-hold actions or showing additional options.
  final GestureLongPressStartCallback? onLongPressStart;
  /// Callback invoked when a long press gesture completes.
  final GestureLongPressUpCallback? onLongPressUp;
  /// Callback invoked when a long press gesture moves.
  ///
  /// Provides position updates during an active long press. Useful for
  /// implementing drag-from-long-press behaviors.
  final GestureLongPressMoveUpdateCallback? onLongPressMoveUpdate;
  /// Callback invoked when a long press gesture ends.
  final GestureLongPressEndCallback? onLongPressEnd;
  /// Callback invoked when a secondary button long press completes.
  final GestureLongPressUpCallback? onSecondaryLongPress;
  /// Callback invoked when a tertiary button long press completes.
  final GestureLongPressUpCallback? onTertiaryLongPress;
  /// Whether to disable hover visual effects.
  ///
  /// When true, the button doesn't show visual changes on hover, though [onHover]
  /// callbacks are still called. Useful for custom hover implementations.
  final bool disableHoverEffect;
  /// Controller for managing button widget states externally.
  ///
  /// Allows external control over hover, pressed, focused, and other widget states.
  /// Useful for implementing custom state logic or coordinating with other widgets.
  final WidgetStatesController? statesController;
  /// Alignment for the button's margin within its allocated space.
  ///
  /// Controls how the button positions itself within its parent's constraints
  /// when the button is smaller than the available space.
  final AlignmentGeometry? marginAlignment;
  /// Whether to disable the focus outline.
  ///
  /// When true, removes the visual focus indicator that appears when the button
  /// is focused via keyboard navigation. Use carefully as this affects accessibility.
  final bool disableFocusOutline;
  /// Creates a [Button] with custom styling.
  ///
  /// This is the base constructor that allows complete customization of the button's
  /// appearance and behavior through the [style] parameter. For common use cases,
  /// consider using the named constructors like [Button.primary] or [Button.secondary].
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [statesController] (WidgetStatesController?, optional): External state management.
  /// - [leading] (Widget?, optional): Widget displayed before the main content.
  /// - [trailing] (Widget?, optional): Widget displayed after the main content.
  /// - [child] (Widget, required): Main content of the button.
